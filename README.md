The aim of this project was to predict car prices based on their features using a linear regression model. A dataset containing information on the year, selling price, mileage, fuel type, seller type, transmission, ownership, mileage, engine, maximum power, and torque of vehicles was used to achieve this goal.

The results of the project were quite successful. The model's MAE, MSE, and RMSE values were all low, while the R2 score was high. These results indicate that the model performed well in predicting car prices.

To improve the project, better results can be obtained by using different regression algorithms or adding more features. However, even in its current state, the project can be a useful resource for those looking to gain more insights into car prices.
